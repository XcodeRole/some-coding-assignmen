# Question4
1. I am confident in the correctness of the program because I write the code with basically all the tests in mind.I think there will be a lot of bugs in writing check_range as the documentation requires.For example ,python will consider index -1 as the last element, if the user enters -9 as the first element, then seen[-9]==seen[0]==True, but actually seen[0] should be False.But for the sake of marks, I can only code as the documentation asks, which is causing me a lot of trouble!
2. I'm just writing code exactly as required by the course, and can't write more efficient code that doesn't meet the requirements.So I think, the code is less efficient!Time complexity or space complexity?
3. I believe my code would be more adaptable if programming could be freer.If you program according to the requirements specified in the document, everyone's code adaptability should be similar.
4. I think the robustness of the program is relatively poor.For example, I default that the user will enter 9 numbers,and my program can only detect 3*3 matrices.If the user enters more numbers, the program will not report an error, but it will not execute correctly.
5. About half an hour just as the same time as I planned.I didn't use  the given implementation plan,because I have my own programming habits.At first, I thought the idea of ​​using array subscripts to verify the range of integers was good, but there may be some bugs to use it in the python language, and it may be feasible in the C language.
6. Maybe thirst will interrupt me, other than that, I'm very focused while programming.
