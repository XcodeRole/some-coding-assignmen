1. I'm pretty confident the program is correct.Because my program can pass all tests! If there is one thing I haven't considered, it is the syntax of THO, such as the user entering illegal instructions.

3. The entire code is written very smoothly, with few pauses.When I write code, my energy is still relatively concentrated.
