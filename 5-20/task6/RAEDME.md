# Problem 6
Given a set of x,y data points,it is often necessary to automatically calculate an equation which gives the best fit line through the data.This type of analysis is known as line fitting or regression analysis.
The mathematical basis behind line fitting is shown below.You have a set of data points represented by (x1.y1),(x2.y2).....(xn,yn).You want an equation which represents this data,the exact type of equation will depend on the way in which the data varies.Given any mathematical relationship between x and y it should be possible to generate a line fitting algorithm.The line fitting algorithm is described below.
## Straight line
The equation for a straight line is:y=ax +b.Suppose that we have n points of(x,y)values from the text file,the values of a and b for the best fit line that is the best approximation of the given set of data points can be obtained from the following equation:
