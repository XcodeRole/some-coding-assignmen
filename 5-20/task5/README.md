# Problem 5
Given a circle class to represent circle information as follows:
class Circle{
    int x;
    int y;
    double radius;
};
Write a program to achieve the following tasks:
1. The centre point of(x.y)and radius should be inputted from the keyboard.(1 mark)
2. Define a method that can calculate and return the circle's area.(1 marks)
3. Define an overloading operator to add two circle objects and get a new circle object.The centre point of the new circle object is the same as the centre point of the first circle object. The area of the new circle object should be the sum of the areas of two circle objects (You can calculate the radius of the new circle based on the sum of the area of two circles).(2 marks)
4. Define a function to print relations of two circles(interaction,tangency,separation and inside)(2 marks)
5. Define a main function to input two circle objects,get a new circle object based on these two circle objects and print the relations of these two circle objects.(2 marks)
6. Compile and run correctly.(2 marks)

# run it
