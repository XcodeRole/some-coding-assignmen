# Problem.1
Write a function 
Int[] union_Array (int a[], int lenA, int b[], int lenB) 
that constructs the union of two integer arrays and removes any element that occurs more than once. 
For example, if two arrays of the union_Array are {1, 8, 16 } and {11, 8, 7, 1}, it will return an array 
of {1, 8, 16, 11, 7}. 
Tasks: 
1. The length of two arrays  should be different and defined  by constants  using "#define"  (1 mark) 
2. Arrays are inputted from the keyboard.(1 mark) 
3. Call the function union_Array in your main function.Initialize two arrays.Print out the new array (there is no requirement for the order of the output elements).(1 marks)
4. Compile and run correctly (2 marks)

# run it
command : make && ./task1
