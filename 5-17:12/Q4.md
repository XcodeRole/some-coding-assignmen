1. I'm pretty confident about the correctness of the program,I tested several txt documents and they are all correct,which prove my coding logic is right.There should be no incorrect spot in my code.
2. Takes about an hour,At first, I planned to use the matrix multiplication operation to be equivalent to the original four operations, but it was unsuccessful. Finally, I used the numpy math library to splicing the matrix to complete the task.This took a lot longer than I expected, with learning numpy taking the longest.
3. As mentioned in question 2, when I write code, I am very focused and rarely interrupted by foreign objects, but occasionally I am interrupted by program bugs.
