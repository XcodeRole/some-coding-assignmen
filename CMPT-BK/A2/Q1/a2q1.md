# Question 1
copyA()
- makes a copy
- Used in the following way:
  - acopy=copyA(unsorted)

copyB
- does not make a copy
- The process of removing the original list destroys the iterator of the for loop

copyC()
- makes a copy
- Used in the following way:
  - acopy=copyA(unsorted)
- But it just copies the reference, it does not actually create a new list, it is a shallow copy, we cannot use this function

copyD()
- makes a copy
- Used in the following way:
  - acopy=[]
    copyD(unsorted,acopy)
copyE()
- makes a copy
- Used in the following way:
  - acopy=copyE(unsorted)
